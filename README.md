# To-Do-list
A To-Do List is a simple yet highly effective tool that helps individuals organize tasks, goals, and responsibilities in a structured manner. It is used to track tasks that need to be completed, ensuring that nothing is forgotten and everything is done in an organized and timely way. To-do lists are commonly used for personal organization, work-related tasks, study planning, and many other applications.

Basic Operations of a To-Do List
A To-Do List allows users to manage their tasks by performing a few essential operations. These include:

Adding a Task: Users can add tasks or items that they need to accomplish. These tasks are typically entered with a brief description of what needs to be done.
Marking a Task as Completed: Once a task is done, it can be marked as completed to signify that it no longer requires attention.
Deleting a Task: If a task is no longer relevant or needed, it can be removed from the list entirely.
Viewing the List: The to-do list shows the user both completed and pending tasks, keeping them updated on their progress.
Operations in Detail
1. Adding a Task
The first operation is adding a task to the list. This is where a user writes down what they need to do, such as "Buy groceries" or "Complete project report." It may also include setting due dates or priorities for certain tasks.

Example:
"Add Task" button: When clicked, this allows the user to enter a task.
Input Field: A text field where the user types the task description.
A button or event trigger that adds this task to the list after entering the text.
2. Completing a Task
Once a task is completed, users can mark it as done. This is usually done by clicking a checkbox or changing the task’s visual appearance (such as crossing it out or changing the color).

Example:
Checkbox: Next to each task, there’s a checkbox that users click to mark a task as completed.
Task Styling: After completion, the task may change appearance (e.g., strikethrough text, gray color) to visually distinguish completed tasks.
3. Deleting a Task
Sometimes tasks may become irrelevant, or users simply want to remove them from the list. Deleting tasks helps to keep the to-do list clean and focused only on what’s important.

Example:
Delete Button: Each task typically has a delete button (such as a trash icon) next to it. Clicking this will remove the task from the list.
4. Viewing the To-Do List
A key feature of the To-Do List is the ability to see all of your tasks, whether completed or pending. The user can often filter or sort tasks by categories such as due date or priority.

Example:
Task Display: Each task will be displayed as a list item, with options for completing or deleting next to each task.
